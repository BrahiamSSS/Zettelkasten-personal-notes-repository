# Plural form 
Plural form is the correct manner to write nouns when they are not 
singular. In other words, we use the plural form to talk of more 
than one nouns.
## Grammar structure
The plural form for nouns follows the next grammar rules:
### S plural form
The most common plural form for nouns is only adding "s" at the end
of the word.
### ES plural form
If the word finish with S, SH, CH, X, Z then we add a "es" at the end 
of the word.
### Words with Y
If the word finish with "Y" we have two grammar rules. If the word finish 
with a vowels follow by "Y" we add "s" at the end of the word. On the 
other hand, if the word finish with a consonant follow by "Y" we add "ies".
### Exceptions
There are many words that doesn't follow a grammar rule and we have to 
memorize it.

# Personal thoughts:
The plural form of nouns is the first hard step in learning English from
zero, because English have a lot of irregular plural form for nouns and 
we needed to start write correct sentences in English.
